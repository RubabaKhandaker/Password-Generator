This is a customisable random password generator that showcases some of the core JavaScript skills I have learnt during week 3 of the MONU coding bootcamp .

## Usage

To generate a random password, click on the red "Generate Password" button to get started. Follow along the window prompts to customise your generated password. Once completed, your generated password will appear in the textbox labelled "Your Secure Password." To generate another password, simply click the red button and follow through the process again.

To view the source code of the webpage, open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see the source code of the webpage.
